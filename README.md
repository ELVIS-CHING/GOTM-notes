# GOTM-notes
personal notes for using GOTM

## BACKGROUND  

- **GOTM**  
  [GOTM](https://gotm.net/portfolio/) is the result of the effort by a number of people to make 'state-of-the-art' turbulence model for natural waters.
  
- **FABM**  
  [FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm) is a Fortran 2003 programming framework for biogeochemical models of marine and freshwater systems.
  
- **CVMix**  
  The Community Vertical Mixing Project ([CVMix](http://cvmix.github.io/#top)) is a portable vertical mixing software package providing an extensible framework for the development of first-order closures.
  It has been coupled with **GOTM** by [Prof. Li, Q.](https://github.com/qingli411/gotmwork#Setup) ([Integrating CVMix into GOTM (v6.0): a consistent framework for testing, comparing, and applying ocean mixing schemes](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4261/2021/))
